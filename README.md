# DIABETES-PREDICTION
this model based on machine learning and this is my first machine learning model.
I have complete this project as a part of training and internship at IIT Kanpur.
this model will check whether the person has diabetes or not,I trained this model with the help of different diffrent libraries like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes.
and i have seen that which library is having the highest accuracy, i trained it and then predict person has diabetes or not.
i gave all these as input variables like pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreefunction, Age and find the taget variable i.e. outcome(diabetes or not).
